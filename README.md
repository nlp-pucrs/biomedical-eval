Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluation of the Quality ofBiomedical Embeddings in Different Languages

**Author:** Paula M. Franceschini, Henrique D. P. dos Santos and Renata Vieira

**Abstract:** Lately, language models have been applied to severaltasks  in  biomedical  natural  language  processing.  Some  publiclanguage  models  are  available  online,  each  built  with  differentcorpora. In this paper, we evaluate different public word embed-ding models trained with both general and biomedical corpora forEnglish  and  Portuguese.  We  present  intrinsic  evaluations  basedon  semantic  analogies  that  use  word  pairs  extracted  from  theMeSH biomedical thesaurus and also from benchmarks that areavailable for general-domain evaluation. For extrinsic evaluationswe  rely  on  a  classification  task  over  Eletronic  Health  Records.Our  experiments  show  that  biomedical  embeddings  can  bettercapture semantics for biomedical analogies in both languages. Onthe  other  hand  for  extrinsic  evaluation,  based  on  classificationtasks  using  the  language  models,  larger  general  textual  corporaappeared  equally  or  more  effective.
